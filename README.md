# The Game of Life

This is my version of [Conwayâ€™s game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

You can add `?grid=1010` to the base URL to start the grid off in a particular configuration. E.g., try this link to [see the board start with a basic glider going from top/left to bottom/right](https://segdelife.netlify.app/?grid=0100000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000111) or this link to [see the board start with a penta-decathlon](https://segdelife.netlify.app/?grid=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111000000000000000000000000000001010000000000000000000000000000011100000000000000000000000000000111000000000000000000000000000001110000000000000000000000000000011100000000000000000000000000000101000000000000000000000000000001110000000000000000).
